## HTTP Verb Tampering

To understand `HTTP Verb Tampering`, we must first learn about the different methods accepted by the HTTP protocol. HTTP has [9 different verbs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) that can be accepted as HTTP methods by web servers. Other than `GET` and `POST`, the following are some of the commonly used HTTP verbs:

| Verb      | Description                                                                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `HEAD`    | Identical to a GET request, but its response only contains the `headers`, without the response body |
| `PUT`     | Writes the request payload to the specified location                                                |
| `DELETE`  | Deletes the resource at the specified location                                                      |
| `OPTIONS` | Shows different options accepted by a web server, like accepted HTTP verbs                          |
| `PATCH`   | Apply partial modifications to the resource at the specified location                               |
As you can imagine, some of the above methods can perform very sensitive functionalities, like writing (`PUT`) or deleting (`DELETE`) files to the webroot directory on the back-end server. If a web server is not securely configured to manage these methods, we can use them to gain control over the back-end server. However, what makes HTTP Verb Tampering attacks more common (and hence more critical), is that they are caused by a misconfiguration in either the back-end web server or the web application, either of which can cause the vulnerability.
# Bypassing Basic Authentication
So, it seems like the web server configurations do cover both `GET` and `POST` requests. However, as we have previously learned, we can utilize many other HTTP methods, most notably the `HEAD` method, which is identical to a `GET` request but does not return the body in the HTTP response. If this is successful, we may not receive any output, but the `reset` function should still get executed, which is our main target.

To see whether the server accepts `HEAD` requests, we can send an `OPTIONS` request to it and see what HTTP methods are accepted, as follows:

```
MarcosV999@htb[/htb]$ curl -i -X OPTIONS http://SERVER_IP:PORT/

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: 
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
Allow: POST,OPTIONS,HEAD,GET
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: httpd/unix-directory
```

As we can see, the response shows `Allow: POST,OPTIONS,HEAD,GET`, which means that the web server indeed accepts `HEAD` requests, which is the default configuration for many web servers.

Once we change `POST` to `HEAD` and forward the request, we will see that we no longer get a login prompt or a `401 Unauthorized` page and get an empty output instead, as expected with a `HEAD` request. If we go back to the `File Manager` web application, we will see that all files have indeed been deleted, meaning that we successfully triggered the `Reset` functionality without having admin access or any credentials

# Bypassing Security Filters
The other and more common type of HTTP Verb Tampering vulnerability is caused by `Insecure Coding` errors made during the development of the web application, which lead to web application not covering all HTTP methods in certain functionalities. This is commonly found in security filters that detect malicious requests. For example, if a security filter was being used to detect injection vulnerabilities and only checked for injections in `POST` parameters (e.g. `$_POST['parameter']`), it may be possible to bypass it by simply changing the request method to `GET`.
...
...
To confirm whether we bypassed the security filter, we need to attempt exploiting the vulnerability the filter is protecting: a Command Injection vulnerability, in this case. So, we can inject a command that creates two files and then check whether both files were created. To do so, we will use the following file name in our attack (`file1; touch file2;`):

Then, we can once again change the request method to a `POST` request:
![](Pasted%20image%2020260715231610.png)

Once we send our request, we see that this time both `file1` and `file2` were created:

# Verb Tampering Prevention

## Insecure Configuration

HTTP Verb Tampering vulnerabilities can occur in most modern web servers, including `Apache`, `Tomcat`, and `ASP.NET`. The vulnerability usually happens when we limit a page's authorization to a particular set of HTTP verbs/methods, which leaves the other remaining methods unprotected.

The following is an example of a vulnerable configuration for an Apache web server, which is located in the site configuration file (e.g. `000-default.conf`), or in a `.htaccess` web page configuration file:
```
<Directory "/var/www/html/admin">
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Admin Panel"
    AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/.htpasswd
    <Limit GET>
        Require valid-user
    </Limit>
</Directory>
```
As we can see, this configuration is setting the authorization configurations for the `admin` web directory. However, as the `<Limit GET>` keyword is being used, the `Require valid-user` setting will only apply to `GET` requests, leaving the page accessible through `POST` requests. Even if both `GET` and `POST` were specified, this would leave the page accessible through other methods, like `HEAD` or `OPTIONS`.

The following example shows the same vulnerability for a `Tomcat` web server configuration, which can be found in the `web.xml` file for a certain Java web application:
```
<security-constraint>
    <web-resource-collection>
        <url-pattern>/admin/*</url-pattern>
        <http-method>GET</http-method>
    </web-resource-collection>
    <auth-constraint>
        <role-name>admin</role-name>
    </auth-constraint>
</security-constraint>
```
We can see that the authorization is being limited only to the `GET` method with `http-method`, which leaves the page accessible through other HTTP methods.

Finally, the following is an example for an `ASP.NET` configuration found in the `web.config` file of a web application:
```
<system.web>
    <authorization>
        <allow verbs="GET" roles="admin">
            <deny verbs="GET" users="*">
        </deny>
        </allow>
    </authorization>
</system.web>
```
Once again, the `allow` and `deny` scope is limited to the `GET` method, which leaves the web application accessible through other HTTP methods.
If we want to specify a single method, we can use safe keywords, like `LimitExcept` in Apache, `http-method-omission` in Tomcat, and `add`/`remove` in ASP.NET, which cover all verbs except the specified ones.
Finally, to avoid similar attacks, we should generally `consider disabling/denying all HEAD requests` unless specifically required by the web application.

## Insecure Coding
Let's consider the following `PHP` code from our `File Manager` exercise:
```
if (isset($_REQUEST['filename'])) {
    if (!preg_match('/[^A-Za-z0-9. _-]/', $_POST['filename'])) {
        system("touch " . $_REQUEST['filename']);
    } else {
        echo "Malicious Request Denied!";
    }
}
```
To avoid HTTP Verb Tampering vulnerabilities in our code, `we must be consistent with our use of HTTP methods` and ensure that the same method is always used for any specific functionality across the web application. It is always advised to `expand the scope of testing in security filters` by testing all request parameters. This can be done with the following functions and variables:

|Language|Function|
|---|---|
|PHP|`$_REQUEST['param']`|
|Java|`request.getParameter('param')`|
|C#|`Request['param']`|
