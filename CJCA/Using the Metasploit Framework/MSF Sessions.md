# Sessions
MSFconsole can manage multiple modules at the same time. This is one of the many reasons it provides the user with so much flexibility. This is done with the use of `Sessions`, which creates dedicated control interfaces for all of your deployed modules.
Once several sessions are created, we can switch between them and link a different module to one of the backgrounded sessions to run on it or turn them into jobs. Note that once a session is placed in the background, it will continue to run, and our connection to the target host will persist. Sessions can, however, die if something goes wrong during the payload runtime, causing the communication channel to tear down.
#### Listing Active Sessions

We can use the `sessions` command to view our currently active sessions.
```
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/psexec_psh) > sessions

Active sessions
===============

  Id  Name  Type                     Information                 Connection
  --  ----  ----                     -----------                 ----------
  1         meterpreter x86/windows  NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM @ MS01  10.10.10.129:443 -> 10.10.10.205:50501 (10.10.10.205)
```
## Jobs

If, for example, we are running an active exploit under a specific port and need this port for a different module, we cannot simply terminate the session using `[CTRL] + [C]`. If we did that, we would see that the port would still be in use, affecting our use of the new module. So instead, we would need to use the `jobs` command to look at the currently active tasks running in the background and terminate the old ones to free up the port.
#### Viewing the Jobs Command Help Menu

We can view the help menu for this command, like others, by typing `jobs -h`.
#### Viewing the Exploit Command Help Menu

When we run an exploit, we can run it as a job by typing `exploit -j`. Per the help menu for the `exploit` command, adding `-j` to our command. Instead of just `exploit` or `run`, will "run it in the context of a job."
```
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > exploit -h
Usage: exploit [options]

Launches an exploitation attempt.

OPTIONS:

    -J        Force running in the foreground, even if passive.
    -e <opt>  The payload encoder to use.  If none is specified, ENCODER is used.
    -f        Force the exploit to run regardless of the value of MinimumRank.
    -h        Help banner.
    -j        Run in the context of a job.
```

#### Running an Exploit as a Background Job
```
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > exploit -j
[*] Exploit running as background job 0.
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.34:4444
```
#### Listing Running Jobs

To list all running jobs, we can use the `jobs -l` command. To kill a specific job, look at the index no. of the job and use the `kill [index no.]` command. Use the `jobs -K` command to kill all running jobs.
```
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > jobs -l
