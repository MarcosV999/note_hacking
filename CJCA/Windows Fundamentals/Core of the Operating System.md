# Operating System Structure
In Windows operating systems, the root directory is <drive_letter>:\ (commonly C drive). The root directory (also known as the boot partition) is where the operating system is installed.
## Exploring Directories Using Command Line
We can explore the file system using the [dir](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/dir) command.
```
C:\htb> dir c:\ /a
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is F416-77BE

 Directory of c:\

```
The [tree](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/tree) utility is useful for graphically displaying the directory structure of a path or disk.
```
C:\htb> tree "c:\Program Files (x86)\VMware"
Folder PATH listing
Volume serial number is F416-77BE
C:\PROGRAM FILES (X86)\VMWARE
├───VMware VIX
│   ├───doc
│   │   ├───errors
│   │   ├───features
│   │   ├───lang
│   │   │   └───c
│   │   │       └───functions
│   │   └───types
│   ├───samples
│   └───Workstation-15.0.0
│       ├───32bit
│       └───64bit
```
The `tree` command can provide us with a large amount of information. The following command can be used to walk through all the files in the C drive, one screen at a time.
```
tree c:\ /f | more
```

# File System
There are 5 types of Windows file systems: FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, NTFS, and exFAT. FAT12 and FAT16 are no longer used on modern Windows operating systems.
- FAT32 (File Allocation Table) is widely used across many types of storage devices such as USB memory sticks and SD cards but can also be used to format hard drives. The "32" in the name refers to the fact that FAT32 uses 32 bits of data for identifying data clusters on a storage device.
- NTFS (New Technology File System) is the default Windows file system since Windows NT 3.1. In addition to making up for the shortcomings of FAT32, NTFS also has better support for metadata and better performance due to improved data structuring.

## Permissions

|Permission Type|Description|
|---|---|
|Full Control|Allows reading, writing, changing, deleting of files/folders.|
|Modify|Allows reading, writing, and deleting of files/folders.|
|List Folder Contents|Allows for viewing and listing folders and subfolders as well as executing files. Folders only inherit this permission.|
|Read and Execute|Allows for viewing and listing files and subfolders as well as executing files. Files and folders inherit this permission.|
|Write|Allows for adding files to folders and subfolders and writing to a file.|
|Read|Allows for viewing and listing of folders and subfolders and viewing a file's contents.|
|Traverse Folder|This allows or denies the ability to move through folders to reach other files or folders. For example, a user may not have permission to list the directory contents or view files in the documents or web apps directory in this example c:\users\bsmith\documents\webapps\backups\backup_02042020.zip but with Traverse Folder permissions applied, they can access the backup archive.|
## Integrity Control Access Control List (icacls)
We can list out the NTFS permissions on a specific directory by running either `icacls` from within the working directory or `icacls C:\Windows` against a directory not currently in.
```
C:\htb> icacls c:\windows
c:\windows NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller:(F)
           NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller:(CI)(IO)(F)
           NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(M)
           NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
           BUILTIN\Administrators:(M)
           BUILTIN\Administrators:(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
           BUILTIN\Users:(RX)
           BUILTIN\Users:(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)
           CREATOR OWNER:(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
           APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(RX)
           APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)
           APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES:(RX)
           APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES:(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)

Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files
```
The resource access level is listed after each user in the output. The possible inheritance settings are:

- `(CI)`: container inherit
- `(OI)`: object inherit
- `(IO)`: inherit only
- `(NP)`: do not propagate inherit
- `(I)`: permission inherited from parent container

In the above example, the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account has object inherit, container inherit, inherit only, and full access permissions. This means that this account has full control over all file system objects in this directory and subdirectories.

Basic access permissions are as follows:

- `F` : full access
- `D` :  delete access
- `N` :  no access
- `M` :  modify access
- `RX` :  read and execute access
- `R` :  read-only access
- `W` :  write-only access

Using the command `icacls c:\users /grant joe:f` we can grant the joe user full control over the directory, but given that `(oi)` and `(ci)` were not included in the command, the joe user will only have rights over the `c:\users` folder but not over the user subdirectories and files contained within them.

```
C:\htb> icacls c:\users /grant joe:f
processed file: c:\users
Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files
```

```
C:\htb> >icacls c:\users
c:\users WS01\joe:(F)
         NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)(F)
         BUILTIN\Administrators:(OI)(CI)(F)
         BUILTIN\Users:(RX)
         BUILTIN\Users:(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)
         Everyone:(RX)
         Everyone:(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)

Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files
```

These permissions can be revoked using the command `icacls c:\users /remove joe`.

# NTFS vs. Share Permissions
The `Server Message Block protocol` (`SMB`) is used in Windows to connect shared resources like files and printers. It is used in large, medium, and small enterprise environments.
NTFS permissions and share permissions are often understood to be the same. Please know that they are not the same but often apply to the same shared resource.
#### Share permissions

|Permission|Description|
|---|---|
|`Full Control`|Users are permitted to perform all actions given by Change and Read permissions as well as change permissions for NTFS files and subfolders|
|`Change`|Users are permitted to read, edit, delete and add files and subfolders|
|`Read`|Users are allowed to view file & subfolder contents|
#### NTFS Basic permissions

|Permission|Description|
|---|---|
|`Full Control`|Users are permitted to add, edit, move, delete files & folders as well as change NTFS permissions that apply to all allowed folders|
|`Modify`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to view and modify files and folders. This includes adding or deleting files|
|`Read & Execute`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to read the contents of files and execute programs|
|`List folder contents`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to view a listing of files and subfolders|
|`Read`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to read the contents of files|
|`Write`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to write changes to a file and add new files to a folder|
|`Special Permissions`|A variety of advanced permissions options|

The `net share` command allows us to view all the shared folders on the system. Notice the share we created and also the C:\ drive.

We didn't manually share C:. The most important drive with the most critical files on a Windows system is shared via SMB at install. This means anyone with the proper access could remotely access the entire C:\ of each Windows system on a network.

We can also see the share we created.

#### Viewing Share access logs in Event Viewer

`Event Viewer` is another good place to investigate actions completed on Windows. Almost every operating system has a logging mechanism and a utility to view the logs that were captured. Know that a log is like a journal entry for a computer, where the computer writes down all the actions that were performed and numerous details associated with that action. We can view the logs created for every action we performed when accessing the Windows 10 target box, as well as when creating, editing and accessing the shared folder.
