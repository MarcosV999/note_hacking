# Desktop Experience vs. Server Core
In Server Core, all configuration and maintenance tasks are performed via the command-line, PowerShell, or remote management with MMC or Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT).

While Server Core aims to have a smaller footprint by lacking a GUI, some graphical programs are still supported, such as Registry Editor, Notepad, System Information, Windows Installer, Task Manager, and PowerShell. It also supports some Sysinternals suite tools such as Active Directory Explorer, Process Explorer, Process Monitor, and TCPView.
As of Windows Server 2019, Server Core or Desktop Experience must be selected at installation. Once installed, the initial setup for Server Core can be done via `Sconfig`, which is a text-based interface. `Sconfig` is used for performing a variety of common commands such as configuring networking, checking for/installing Windows updates, account management, configuring remote management, activating Windows, and more.

In summary, Server Core is lighter weight and less resource-intensive but has a steeper learning curve and can be more difficult to manage. It also has some limitations, such as performing management tasks using certain GUI programs.

# Windows Security
Security is a critical topic in Windows operating systems. Windows systems have many moving parts that present a vast attack surface. Due to the many built-in applications, features, and layers of settings, Windows systems can be easily misconfigured, thus opening them up to attack even if they are fully patched.
Windows follows certain security principles to control access and authentication within the system. These principles apply to various entities, such as users, networked computers, threads, and processes, which can be authorized for specific actions. The security model is designed to minimize the risk of unauthorized access, making it more challenging for attackers or malicious software to exploit the system.
## Security Identifier (SID)

Each of the security principals on the system has a unique security identifier (SID). The system automatically generates SIDs. This means that even if, for example, we have two identical users on the system, Windows can distinguish the two and their rights based on their SIDs. SIDs are string values with different lengths, which are stored in the security database. These SIDs are added to the user's access token to identify all actions that the user is authorized to take.
A SID consists of the Identifier Authority and the Relative ID (RID). In an Active Directory (AD) domain environment, the SID also includes the domain SID.
```
PS C:\htb> whoami /user

USER INFORMATION
----------------

User Name           SID
=================== =============================================
ws01\bob S-1-5-21-674899381-4069889467-2080702030-1002
```
The SID is broken down into this pattern.
```
(SID)-(revision level)-(identifier-authority)-(subauthority1)-(subauthority2)-(etc)
```
Let's break down the SID piece by piece.

|**Number**|**Meaning**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|S|SID|Identifies the string as a SID.|
|1|Revision Level|To date, this has never changed and has always been `1`.|
|5|Identifier-authority|A 48-bit string that identifies the authority (the computer or network) that created the SID.|
|21|Subauthority1|This is a variable number that identifies the user's relation or group described by the SID to the authority that created it. It tells us in what order this authority created the user's account.|
|674899381-4069889467-2080702030|Subauthority2|Tells us which computer (or domain) created the number|
|1002|Subauthority3|The RID that distinguishes one account from another. Tells us whether this user is a normal user, a guest, an administrator, or part of some other group|

## User Account Control (UAC)

[User Account Control (UAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works) is a security feature in Windows to prevent malware from running or manipulating processes that could damage the computer or its contents. There is the Admin Approval Mode in UAC, which is designed to prevent unwanted software from being installed without the administrator's knowledge or to prevent system-wide changes from being made.
## Registry

The [Registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry) is a hierarchical database in Windows critical for the operating system. It stores low-level settings for the Windows operating system and applications that choose to use it. It is divided into computer-specific and user-specific data. We can open the Registry Editor by typing `regedit` from the command line or Windows search bar.
The entire system registry is stored in several files on the operating system. You can find these under `C:\Windows\System32\Config\`.
```
PS C:\htb> ls

    Directory: C:\Windows\system32\config

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name

```
The user-specific registry hive (HKCU) is stored in the user folder (i.e., `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\Ntuser.dat`).
```
PS C:\htb> gci -Hidden

## Application Whitelisting
Whitelisting is recommended by organizations such as [NIST](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-167.pdf), especially in high-security environments.

## AppLocker

[AppLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/applocker-overview) is Microsoft's application whitelisting solution and was first introduced in Windows 7. AppLocker gives system administrators control over which applications and files users can run. It gives granular control over executables, scripts, Windows installer files, DLLs, packaged apps, and packed app installers.
## Local Group Policy

Group Policy allows administrators to set, configure, and adjust a variety of settings. In a domain environment, group policies are pushed down from a Domain Controller onto all domain-joined machines that Group Policy objects (GPOs) are linked to. These settings can also be defined on individual machines using Local Group Policy.
Group Policy can be configured locally, in both domain environments and non-domain environments.
We can open the Local Group Policy Editor by opening the Start menu and typing `gpedit.msc`. The editor is split into two categories under Local Computer Policy - `Computer Configuration` and `User Configuration`.

## Windows Defender Antivirus
Windows Defender Antivirus (Defender), formerly known as Windows Defender, is built-in antivirus that ships for free with Windows operating systems.
Defender comes with several features such as real-time protection, which protects the device from known threats in real-time and cloud-delivered protection, which works in conjunction with automatic sample submission to upload suspicious files for analysis
When files are submitted to the cloud protection service, they are "locked" to prevent any potentially malicious behavior until the analysis is complete. Another feature is Tamper Protection, which prevents security settings from being changed through the Registry, PowerShell cmdlets, or group policy.
We can use the PowerShell cmdlet `Get-MpComputerStatus` to check which protection settings are enabled.
```
PS C:\htb> Get-MpComputerStatus | findstr "True"
AMServiceEnabled                : True
AntispywareEnabled              : True
AntivirusEnabled                : True
BehaviorMonitorEnabled          : True
IoavProtectionEnabled           : True
IsTamperProtected               : True
NISEnabled                      : True
OnAccessProtectionEnabled       : True
RealTimeProtectionEnabled       : True
```
