[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) is the most popular open source Content Management System (CMS)
WordPress is written in PHP and usually runs on Apache with MySQL as the backend.
WordPress requires a fully installed and configured LAMP stack (Linux operating system, Apache HTTP Server, MySQL database, and the PHP programming language) before installation on a Linux host.

## Key WordPress Files

- `index.php` is the homepage of WordPress.
- `license.txt` contains useful information such as the version WordPress installed.
- `wp-activate.php` is used for the email activation process when setting up a new WordPress site.
- `wp-admin` folder contains the login page for administrator access and the backend dashboard. Once a user has logged in, they can make changes to the site based on their assigned permissions. The login page can be located at one of the following paths:
    - `/wp-admin/login.php`
    - `/wp-admin/wp-login.php`
    - `/login.php`
    - `/wp-login.php`

This file can also be renamed to make it more challenging to find the login page.
- `xmlrpc.php` is a file representing a feature of WordPress that enables data to be transmitted with HTTP acting as the transport mechanism and XML as the encoding mechanism. This type of communication has been replaced by the WordPress [REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference).
## WordPress Configuration File

- The `wp-config.php` file contains information required by WordPress to connect to the database, such as the database name, database host, username and password, authentication keys and salts, and the database table prefix. This configuration file can also be used to activate DEBUG mode, which can be useful in troubleshooting.
#### wp-config.php
```
<?php
/** <SNIP> */
define( 'DB_NAME', 'database_name_here' );
define( 'DB_USER', 'username_here' );
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'password_here' );
define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' );

/** Authentication Unique Keys and Salts */
/* <SNIP> */
define( 'AUTH_KEY',         'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'SECURE_AUTH_KEY',  'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'LOGGED_IN_KEY',    'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'NONCE_KEY',        'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'AUTH_SALT',        'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'SECURE_AUTH_SALT', 'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'LOGGED_IN_SALT',   'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'NONCE_SALT',       'put your unique phrase here' );

$table_prefix = 'wp_';
```
## Key WordPress Directories
The `wp-content` folder is the main directory where plugins and themes are stored. The subdirectory `uploads/` is usually where any files uploaded to the platform are stored.
#### WP-Content
```
MarcosV999@htb[/htb]$ tree -L 1 /var/www/html/wp-content
.
├── index.php
├── plugins
└── themes
```

`wp-includes` contains everything except for the administrative components and the themes that belong to the website. This is the directory where core files are stored, such as certificates, fonts, JavaScript files, and widgets.
#### WP-Includes
```
MarcosV999@htb[/htb]$ tree -L 1 /var/www/html/wp-includes
.
├── <SNIP>
├── theme.php
├── update.php
├── user.php
├── vars.php
