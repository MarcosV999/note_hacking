# HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
HTTP communication consists of a client and a server, where the client requests the server for a resource. The server processes the requests and returns the requested resource. The default port for HTTP communication is port `80`, though this can be changed to any other port, depending on the web server configuration. The same requests are utilized when we use the internet to visit different websites. We enter a `Fully Qualified Domain Name` (`FQDN`) as a `Uniform Resource Locator` (`URL`) to reach the desired website, like [www.hackthebox.com](http://www.hackthebox.com).

## URL

Resources over HTTP are accessed via a `URL`, which offers many more specifications than simply specifying a website we want to visit. Let's look at the structure of a URL:
![[URL.png]]

| **Component**  | **Example**          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Scheme`       | `http://` `https://` | This is used to identify the protocol being accessed by the client, and ends with a colon and a double slash (`://`)                                                                  |
| `User Info`    | `admin:password@`    | This is an optional component that contains the credentials (separated by a colon `:`) used to authenticate to the host, and is separated from the host with an at sign (`@`)         |
| `Host`         | `inlanefreight.com`  | The host signifies the resource location. This can be a hostname or an IP address                                                                                                     |
| `Port`         | `:80`                | The `Port` is separated from the `Host` by a colon (`:`). If no port is specified, `http` schemes default to port `80` and `https` default to port `443`                              |
| `Path`         | `/dashboard.php`     | This points to the resource being accessed, which can be a file or a folder. If there is no path specified, the server returns the default index (e.g. `index.html`).                 |
| `Query String` | `?login=true`        | The query string starts with a question mark (`?`), and consists of a parameter (e.g. `login`) and a value (e.g. `true`). Multiple parameters can be separated by an ampersand (`&`). |
| `Fragments`    | `#status`            | Fragments are processed by the browsers on the client-side to locate sections within the primary resource (e.g. a header or section on the page).                                     |

## cURL
[cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) (client URL) is a command-line tool and library that primarily supports HTTP along with many other protocols. This makes it a good candidate for scripts as well as automation, making it essential for sending various types of web requests from the command line, which is necessary for many types of web penetration tests.

We may also use cURL to download a page or a file and output the content into a file using the `-O` flag. If we want to specify the output file name, we can use the `-o` flag and specify the name. Otherwise, we can use `-O` and cURL will use the remote file name, as follows: 
```
MarcosV999@htb[/htb]$ curl -O http://info.cern.ch/index.html

  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   646  100   646    0     0   9773      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  9787
```

As we can see, the output was not printed this time but rather saved into `index.html`. We noticed that cURL still printed some status while processing the request. We can silent the status with the `-s` flag.

# Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)
the [HTTPS (HTTP Secure) protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2660) was created, in which all communications are transferred in an encrypted format, so even if a third party does intercept the request, they would not be able to extract the data out of it. For this reason, HTTPS has become the mainstream scheme for websites on the internet, and HTTP is being phased out, and soon most web browsers will not allow visiting HTTP websites.
If we type `http://` instead of `https://` to visit a website that enforces HTTPS, the browser attempts to resolve the domain and redirects the user to the webserver hosting the target website. A request is sent to port `80` first, which is the unencrypted HTTP protocol. The server detects this and redirects the client to secure HTTPS port `443` instead.

## cURL for HTTPS

cURL should automatically handle all HTTPS communication standards and perform a secure handshake and then encrypt and decrypt data automatically. However, if we ever contact a website with an invalid SSL certificate or an outdated one, then cURL by default would not proceed with the communication to protect against the earlier mentioned MITM attacks:

```
MarcosV999@htb[/htb]$ curl https://inlanefreight.com

curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: Invalid certificate chain
More details here: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html
...SNIP...
```

We may face such an issue when testing a local web application or with a web application hosted for practice purposes, as such web applications may not yet have implemented a valid SSL certificate. To skip the certificate check with cURL, we can use the `-k` flag:
```
MarcosV999@htb[/htb]$ curl -k https://www.inlanefreight.com

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<html><head>
...SNIP...
```

# HTTP Requests and Responses

## HTTP Request
![[HTTP REQUEST.png]]

## HTTP Response
![[HTTP RESPONSE.png]]

## cURL
cURL also allows us to preview the full HTTP request and the full HTTP response, which can become very handy when performing web penetration tests or writing exploits. To view the full HTTP request and response, we can simply add the `-v` verbose flag to our earlier commands, and it should print both the request and response:
```
MarcosV999@htb[/htb]$ curl inlanefreight.com -v

*   Trying SERVER_IP:80...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to inlanefreight.com (SERVER_IP) port 80 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: inlanefreight.com
> User-Agent: curl/7.65.3
> Accept: */*
> Connection: close
```
**NOTE:** The `-vvv` flag shows an even more verbose output. Try to use this flag to see what extra request and response details get displayed with it.


# HTTP Headers

Headers can have one or multiple values, appended after the header name and separated by a colon. We can divide headers into the following categories:

1. `General Headers`
2. `Entity Headers`
3. `Request Headers`
4. `Response Headers`
5. `Security Headers`

## General Headers

[General headers](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html) are used in both HTTP requests and responses. They are contextual and are used to `describe the message rather than its contents`.

|**Header**|**Example**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|`Date`|`Date: Wed, 16 Feb 2022 10:38:44 GMT`|Holds the date and time at which the message originated. It's preferred to convert the time to the standard [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) time zone.|
|`Connection`|`Connection: close`|Dictates if the current network connection should stay alive after the request finishes. Two commonly used values for this header are `close` and `keep-alive`. The `close` value from either the client or server means that they would like to terminate the connection, while the `keep-alive` header indicates that the connection should remain open to receive more data and input.|

## Entity Headers

Similar to general headers, [Entity Headers](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec7.html) can be `common to both the request and response`. These headers are used to `describe the content` (entity) transferred by a message. They are usually found in responses and POST or PUT requests.

|**Header**|**Example**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|`Content-Type`|`Content-Type: text/html`|Used to describe the type of resource being transferred. The value is automatically added by the browsers on the client-side and returned in the server response. The `charset` field denotes the encoding standard, such as [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).|
|`Media-Type`|`Media-Type: application/pdf`|The `media-type` is similar to `Content-Type`, and describes the data being transferred. This header can play a crucial role in making the server interpret our input. The `charset` field may also be used with this header.|
|`Boundary`|`boundary="b4e4fbd93540"`|Acts as a marker to separate content when there is more than one in the same message. For example, within a form data, this boundary gets used as `--b4e4fbd93540` to separate different parts of the form.|
|`Content-Length`|`Content-Length: 385`|Holds the size of the entity being passed. This header is necessary as the server uses it to read data from the message body, and is automatically generated by the browser and tools like cURL.|
|`Content-Encoding`|`Content-Encoding: gzip`|Data can undergo multiple transformations before being passed. For example, large amounts of data can be compressed to reduce the message size. The type of encoding being used should be specified using the `Content-Encoding` header.|
## Request Headers

The client sends [Request Headers](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616) in an HTTP transaction. These headers are `used in an HTTP request and do not relate to the content` of the message.

|**Header**|**Example**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|`Host`|`Host: www.inlanefreight.com`|Used to specify the host being queried for the resource. This can be a domain name or an IP address. HTTP servers can be configured to host different websites, which are revealed based on the hostname. This makes the host header an important enumeration target, as it can indicate the existence of other hosts on the target server.|
|`User-Agent`|`User-Agent: curl/7.77.0`|The `User-Agent` header is used to describe the client requesting resources. This header can reveal a lot about the client, such as the browser, its version, and the operating system.|
|`Referer`|`Referer: http://www.inlanefreight.com/`|Denotes where the current request is coming from. For example, clicking a link from Google search results would make `https://google.com` the referer. Trusting this header can be dangerous as it can be easily manipulated, leading to unintended consequences.|
|`Accept`|`Accept: */*`|The `Accept` header describes which media types the client can understand. It can contain multiple media types separated by commas. The `*/*` value signifies that all media types are accepted.|
|`Cookie`|`Cookie: PHPSESSID=b4e4fbd93540`|Contains cookie-value pairs in the format `name=value`. A [cookie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) is a piece of data stored on the client-side and on the server, which acts as an identifier. These are passed to the server per request, thus maintaining the client's access. Cookies can also serve other purposes, such as saving user preferences or session tracking. There can be multiple cookies in a single header separated by a semi-colon.|
|`Authorization`|`Authorization: BASIC cGFzc3dvcmQK`|Another method for the server to identify clients. After successful authentication, the server returns a token unique to the client. Unlike cookies, tokens are stored only on the client-side and retrieved by the server per request. There are multiple types of authentication types based on the webserver and application type used.|

## Response Headers

[Response Headers](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7) can be `used in an HTTP response and do not relate to the content`. Certain response headers such as `Age`, `Location`, and `Server` are used to provide more context about the response.

| **Header**         | **Example**                                 | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Server`           | `Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)`             | Contains information about the HTTP server, which processed the request. It can be used to gain information about the server, such as its version, and enumerate it further.              |
| `Set-Cookie`       | `Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=b4e4fbd93540`        | Contains the cookies needed for client identification. Browsers parse the cookies and store them for future requests. This header follows the same format as the `Cookie` request header. |
| `WWW-Authenticate` | `WWW-Authenticate: BASIC realm="localhost"` | Notifies the client about the type of authentication required to access the requested resource.                                                                                           |

## Security Headers

Finally, we have [Security Headers](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/). With the increase in the variety of browsers and web-based attacks, defining certain headers that enhanced security was necessary. HTTP Security headers are `a class of response headers used to specify certain rules and policies` to be followed by the browser while accessing the website.

| **Header**                  | **Example**                                   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Content-Security-Policy`   | `Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'`  | Dictates the website's policy towards externally injected resources. This could be JavaScript code as well as script resources. This header instructs the browser to accept resources only from certain trusted domains, hence preventing attacks such as [Cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting). |
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000` | Prevents the browser from accessing the website over the plaintext HTTP protocol, and forces all communication to be carried over the secure HTTPS protocol. This prevents attackers from sniffing web traffic and accessing protected information such as passwords or other sensitive data.                                               |
| `Referrer-Policy`           | `Referrer-Policy: origin`                     | Dictates whether the browser should include the value specified via the `Referer` header or not. It can help in avoiding disclosing sensitive URLs and information while browsing the website.                                                                                                                                              |

## cURL

In the previous section, we saw how using the `-v` flag with cURL shows us the full details of the HTTP request and response. If we were only interested in seeing the response headers, then we can use the `-I` flag to send a `HEAD` request and only display the response headers. Furthermore, we can use the `-i` flag to display both the headers and the response body (e.g. HTML code). The difference between the two is that `-I` sends a `HEAD` request (as will see in the next section), while `-i` sends any request we specify and prints the headers as well.

```
MarcosV999@htb[/htb]$ curl -I https://www.inlanefreight.com

Host: www.inlanefreight.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_5) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko)
Cookie: cookie1=298zf09hf012fh2; cookie2=u32t4o3tb3gg4
Accept: text/plain
Referer: https://www.inlanefreight.com/
Authorization: BASIC cGFzc3dvcmQK

Date: Sun, 06 Aug 2020 08:49:37 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
```

In addition to viewing headers, cURL also allows us to set request headers with the `-H` flag, as we will see in a later section. Some headers, like the `User-Agent` or `Cookie` headers, have their own flags. For example, we can use the `-A` to set our `User-Agent`, as follows:
```
MarcosV999@htb[/htb]$ curl https://www.inlanefreight.com -A 'Mozilla/5.0'

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<html><head>
