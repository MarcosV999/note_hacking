| `AUTH PLAIN` | AUTH is a service extension used to authenticate the client.                                     |
| `HELO`       | The client logs in with its computer name and thus starts the session.                           |
| `MAIL FROM`  | The client names the email sender.                                                               |
| `RCPT TO`    | The client names the email recipient.                                                            |
| `DATA`       | The client initiates the transmission of the email.                                              |
| `RSET`       | The client aborts the initiated transmission but keeps the connection between client and server. |
| `VRFY`       | The client checks if a mailbox is available for message transfer.                                |
| `EXPN`       | The client also checks if a mailbox is available for messaging with this command.                |
| `NOOP`       | The client requests a response from the server to prevent disconnection due to time-out.         |
| `QUIT`       | The client terminates the session.                                                               |

To interact with the SMTP server, we can use the `telnet` tool to initialize a TCP connection with the SMTP server. The actual initialization of the session is done with the command mentioned above, `HELO` or `EHLO`.

The command `VRFY` can be used to enumerate existing users on the system. However, this does not always work. Depending on how the SMTP server is configured, the SMTP server may issue `code 252` and confirm the existence of a user that does not exist on the system. A list of all SMTP response codes can be found [here](https://serversmtp.com/smtp-error/).
All the commands we enter in the command line to send an email we know from every email client program like Thunderbird, Gmail, Outlook, and many others. We specify the `subject`, to whom the email should go, CC, BCC, and the information we want to share with others. Of course, the same works from the command line.

Hey man, I am trying to access our XY-DB but the creds don't work. 
Did you make any changes there?

## Footprinting the Service
The default Nmap scripts include `smtp-commands`, which uses the `EHLO` command to list all possible commands that can be executed on the target SMTP server. However, we can also use the [smtp-open-relay](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smtp-open-relay.html) NSE script to identify the target SMTP server as an open relay using 16 different tests.
#### Nmap - Open Relay
```shell
sudo nmap $target -p25 --script smtp-open-relay -v
```

#### User enumeration
Students need to use `smtp-user-enum`, specifying the downloaded wordlist for the `-U` (short version of `file-of-usernames`) option, and 20 for the `-w` option, which sets the maximum number of seconds for waiting for replies:
```shell
smtp-user-enum -M VRFY -U ./footprinting-wordlist.txt -t STMIP -m 60 -w 20
smtp-user-enum -M VRFY -U /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt -t $target -m 60 -w 1
smtp-user-enum -M VRFY -U /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -t $target -m 60 -w 1 -v
```
